# Long Shadow Effects Gallery

This is an open-source gallery app showcasing various long shadow text effects. This project is built to demonstrate the capabilities of a few JavaScript scripts that dynamically generate and apply long shadow styles to text elements.

A live demo of this project can be found here: [Live Demo](https://text-shadow-effects-gallery.vercel.app/)

## 🚧 Disclaimer: Work in Progress 🚧

The text shadow effect scripts located in the `src/effects` folder are currently under development and are **not ready for use in production environments**. This project is a proof of concept and a work in progress.

## -- About the Effects

This gallery primarily showcases three main scripts that use a combination of JavaScript and CSS (via style injection) to create beautiful long shadow effects:

1.  **Striped Shadow (Simplified):** A non-animated version of the striped shadow effect.
2.  **Striped Shadow (Animated):** An animated version of the striped shadow effect.
3.  **Infinite Shadow:** An effect that creates a very long, continuous shadow.

## -- Built With

This application is built using modern web technologies:

*   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
*   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
*   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## -- Future Plans

Some exciting plans for the future of this project:

*   **Consolidation:** Consolidate `infinite-shadow.js` script with `striped-shadow-simplified.js` and `striped-shadow-animated-web-api.js` to create two scripts: one for non-animated/static long shadow effects and another for animated long shadow effects.
*   **Installable Packages:** Create easy-to-use, installable NPM packages that will allow developers to integrate these long shadow effects into their own projects with minimal setup.

## -- Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## -- Deployment

This application is deployed and hosted on [Vercel](https://text-shadow-effects-gallery.vercel.app/).
